The Build Season has begun!

There are four teams: Logistics, Mechanical, Communications and Software.

Software is busy updating the roboRIO (main brain of the robot), updating firmware and trying not to electrocute themselves.

Mechanical is working hard building a model for the field of play, and also building a basic chassis for the robot.

Logistics is working on finances and budget. Making sure we have enough money for pizza.

Communications members are busy writing a blog, fleshing out the website, and tuning all its bells and whistles.
